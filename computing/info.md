# CPU Architecture & Assembly Language Basics

## The CPU & Its Language

The CPU performs main processing in tandem with other hardware components. Instructions given to the CPU are called **assembly language**, and each CPU architecture uses a different flavor of this language.

Any program written in any language (Python, C++, C, and others) is ultimately interpreted/translated into assembly language.

## Major CPU Architectures

### x86 Architecture
- The main architecture frequently referred to in studies
- Created by Intel at the dawn of the PC age
- The most common reference architecture in learning

### ARM Architecture
- Another major architecture
- Together with x86, these make up the majority of PC CPUs worldwide

## Assembly Language Components

Assembly language consists of:

- **Operands** - What we deal with (data)
- **Operations** - Actions like ADD, SUB, MULT (multiplication)

> Assembly is a direct translation of the binary code ingested by the CPU.

## Registers

Registers are another important topic:

- Extremely constrained in number
- Typically **10-20 general purpose registers** available

### Register Example

Moving a value with `rex` prefix:

```assembly
mov rax, value
